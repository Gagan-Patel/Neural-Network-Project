### Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks
Predict student admissions to graduate school based on three pieces of data.
- GRE Scores (Test)
- GPA Scores (Grades)
- Class rank (1-4)

### General overview :

- Loading the data.
- Plotting the data.
- One-hot encoding the input variable we are interested in.
- Scalling the data.
- Splitting the data into Training and Testing.
- Splitting the data into features and targets (labels).
- Training the 1-layer Neural Network.
- Calculating the Accuracy on the Test Data.
